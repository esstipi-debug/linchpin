# Changelog

## [Unreleased]

### Added
- **Client-ready deliverable generator (`src/deliverable.py` + `jobs/inventory_deliverable.py`)** — turns engine output into sellable *documents* (the top hireability gap: "consultants get paid for documents"). Produces a sectioned Markdown report + multi-sheet XLSX with an executive summary, quantified findings, a KPI table with *selection rationale*, a **data-source map** (every figure traceable to its origin + refresh cadence), L3 citations, and a **coverage & handoff** block (confidence + residual human action, honoring the never-unprotected contract). Engine-agnostic — `from_result` composes from any orchestrator `JobResult`; the inventory-optimization adapter turns SKU recommendations + portfolio numbers into the deliverable. Pure/deterministic (prepared date injected, not read from the clock). +11 tests.
- **Operating modes — Inventory vs SCM (`scm_agent/modes.py`)** — two role profiles over one engine. `INVENTORY` mode is the stock-centric subset (reorder points, safety stock, ABC-XYZ, reconciliation, inventory reporting); `SCM` mode is the end-to-end superset (+ S&OP, sourcing, landed cost, logistics, cost-to-serve, risk, sustainability, leadership) and exposes every registered tool. Each mode carries its tool surface, persona, and deliverable/KPI catalogue; `build_registry(mode)` / `orchestrator_for(mode)` scope the orchestrator with no edits to tools. SCM is the default — it never narrows capability unless Inventory is explicitly requested.
- **Operations / strategy / sustainability L3 layer** — ingested four authoritative SCM textbooks into the books knowledge graph (`knowledge/scm-books/`): Vollmann *Manufacturing Planning & Control* (S&OP/MPS/MRP/DRP — the planning/manufacturing spine, 149 nodes), Ivanov *Global Supply Chain & Operations* (sourcing/network/risk/digital, 70 nodes), Christopher *Logistics & SCM* (agility/lead-time/network/3PL, 247 nodes), Grant, Trautrims & Wong *Sustainable Logistics & SCM* (green/reverse logistics/circular economy, 177 nodes), a deepened **Chopra & Meindl** (32 → 312 nodes: strategy, network design, sourcing, transportation, coordination, revenue management), and **Heizer, Render & Munson** *Operations Management* (161 nodes: quality/SPC & Six Sigma, process & layout design, facility location, project management/PERT-CPM, QFD, capacity/TOC, decision analysis). The books graph grew 430 → 1824 nodes / 3640 edges / 122 communities across **23 sources**. Vollmann/Ivanov via the Kimi backend; Christopher/Grant/Chopra/Heizer via host subagents (no API key) — single canonical graph, concepts merged by label into cross-book bridges.
- **Guided Execution Layer (`src/guided.py`)** — the "never leave the user unprotected" contract. A `GuidedOutcome` is either `EXECUTED` or carries an executable path: ranked `ExecutionOption`s, a prepared `HandoffPacket`, or an `EscalationPacket`. `verify_guided()` is a QA gate (same shape as `jobs/qa.py`) that flags any non-executed result with no path as `unprotected`, and any residual without a stated risk. Builders (`as_executed`/`as_options`/`as_handoff`/`as_escalation`) make outcomes protected by construction.
- **Safe-staging writeback (`src/writeback.py`)** — the agent never mutates a system of record directly: `stage()` computes a dry-run `Changeset` (field-level before/after) without writing; risk tiers (read / reversible / irreversible) decide whether a time-boxed `Approval` is required; `apply()` is idempotent on the changeset key; every applied change is audited and `rollback()`-able. Ships an `InMemoryStore` reference connector.
- **Orchestrator guarantee** — `Orchestrator.run()` now attaches a protected `GuidedOutcome` to every `JobResult` at a single boundary (`scm_agent/guided_bridge.py`): ok→executed, needs_clarification→options, needs_data→handoff, qa_failed/error→escalation. New field `JobResult.guided`.
- **ABC-XYZ classification (`src/classification.py`)** — Pareto importance + CV predictability into a 9-cell matrix that assigns a default review policy, cycle-service-level target and buffer distribution per SKU (capability M4).
- **Inventory financial KPIs (`src/financial_kpis.py`)** — inventory turns, DIO, GMROI, sell-through, weeks of supply, inventory-to-sales, cash-to-cash, stockout rate (capability M13 / §4.5).
- **DDMRP buffers + net-flow planning (`src/ddmrp.py`)** — red/yellow/green zones, ADU, TOR/TOY/TOG, net-flow position and planning priority (capability M5).
- **Inventory event detection (`src/alerting.py`)** — stockout-risk / reorder-due / excess / dead-stock detection over a SKU snapshot, surfaced through the Guided Execution Layer as an executable handoff (capability M14, pure core).
- **Forecast accuracy metrics (`src/forecast_metrics.py`)** — MAE/RMSE/bias/MAPE/WAPE/MASE/RMSSE, dependency-free (capability M2).
- **Warehouse space + COI slotting (`src/space.py`)** — cube/m3 sizing, utilization, and class-based slotting by Cube-per-Order Index (capability M7).
- **Inventory reconciliation / IRA (`src/reconciliation.py`)** — system-vs-physical variance, record accuracy, dollar impact, ABC-tiered cycle-count plan (capability M6).
- **Landed-cost / TCO engine (`src/landed_cost.py`)** — Incoterm-aware duty base + freight/insurance/handling/broker, per-unit landed cost (capability M8).
- **Supplier scorecards (`src/supplier_scorecard.py`)** — OTIF/DIFOT, on-time/in-full rates, avg lead time, defect PPM (capability M8).
- **Purchase order (`src/purchase_order.py`)** — immutable PO + guarded state machine (draft→approved→issued→received / cancel) (capability M8).
- **Data-quality core (`src/data_quality.py`)** — GTIN/UPC/EAN check-digit validation, SKU normalization, canonical column mapping (capability M11).
- **SKU deduplication (`src/sku_dedup.py`)** — duplicate detection by shared GTIN + fuzzy name match (rapidfuzz when installed, `difflib` fallback) (capability M11).
- Optional dependency extras: `dataquality` (rapidfuzz, python-stdnum), `mcdm` (pymcdm), `forecast` (statsforecast, utilsforecast) — modules degrade gracefully when absent.
- **Supply-chain leadership grounding (L3)** — ingested Palamariu & Alicke, *From Source to Sold: Stories of Leadership in Supply Chain* (2022) into the books knowledge graph (`knowledge/scm-books/`): +312 leadership concept nodes from 26 leader interviews, plus the book's **CHAIN model** (Collaborative / Holistic / Adaptable / Influential / Narrative) as explicit citable nodes bridged to `supply_chain_strategy`. The books graph grew 430→742 nodes / 763→1384 edges; `scm_agent` `KnowledgeBase.search()` / `explain()` now ground the `leadership_chain` capability with chapter-level citations (previously the CHAIN model was synthesized in code with no L3 source).
- **Voice agent brain (`src/voice/`)** — the credential-free core of capability M16: 7 call playbooks (`playbooks.py`), the outbound-call compliance gate (`compliance.py` — DNC/consent/calling-window/attempt-cap + TCPA/EU-AI-Act AI-disclosure), the 12 logistics document field maps (`doc_schemas.py`), the six-block ElevenLabs system-prompt + agent-config builder (`agent_config.py`), and the curated RAG knowledge base (`knowledge_base/logistics_kb.md`). Only live dialling (ElevenLabs/Twilio) needs credentials.
- Capability Expansion Plan progress: **Fase 0** (foundations) + **Fase 1** + pure cores of **Fases 3-4** (M6/M7/M8/M11/M2-metrics) + first dep-gated module with fallback + **Fase 5 voice-agent brain** (M16, credential-free). See `documentation/CAPABILITY_EXPANSION_PLAN.md`. ~159 new tests; full suite 374 passing, ruff clean.

### Fixed
- **`safety_stock()` regression coverage** — added a test pinned to Vandeput's Table 4.1 worked example that checks the exact signed value through `safety_stock()` itself, closing a gap where the module's own tests didn't catch a sign error in the core formula (only distant integration tests happened to).

### Changed
- **Renamed the project to Linchpin** — repo, distribution package, agent console, and docs. The GitHub repository moved to `esstipi-debug/linchpin` (the old `supply-chain-optimization` URL redirects automatically). The importable module `scm_agent` and the engine package `src` are unchanged.
- **Reframed the README around multi-source grounding.** The value proposition now leads with the project's knowledge graph of 17 SCM books and the codebase, rather than a single book. Per-module academic citations (Vandeput 2020 and others) in `src/` docstrings and the L3 bridge are unchanged — the engine still maps to Vandeput's chapters where it implements them.

## [2.9.0] - 2026-06-24

### Added
- `warehouse_layout` capability (10th tool) + `warehouse/` core: parametric 3D warehouse
  (building, yard, gates, docks, racks, slots), geometry QA, self-contained Three.js viewer,
  webapp `/api/warehouse` + `/warehouse`. Foundation (capa 1a) of the warehouse spatial twin.

## [2.8.0] - 2026-06-21

### Added
- `scm_agent` orchestrator: routes a free-form brief (+ optional data) to a capability and drives prepare → run → QA → deliver.
- `leadership_chain` capability (CHAIN model): score + radar chart + active directives; `jobs/leadership.py`.
- Pluggable `LLMProvider` (Claude when `ANTHROPIC_API_KEY` is set, rules fallback otherwise).
- CLI `examples/run_agent.py` and `POST /api/jobs` HTTP endpoint with downloadable deliverables.
- Optional `llm` and `web` dependency extras.

### Security
- `POST /api/jobs`: sanitize the uploaded filename to a basename pinned inside the per-job directory (blocks path traversal / arbitrary file write) and cap uploads at 25 MB (413 on exceed).

### Hardening
- `POST /api/jobs`: sweep per-job output directories older than `JOBS_TTL_SECONDS` (1 h) on each request so deliverables/uploads don't accumulate.
- `examples/run_agent.py` self-inserts the repo root on `sys.path`, so the documented commands run from any working directory.
- Orchestrator logs swallowed exceptions at `DEBUG` (`exc_info=True`) without breaking the never-crash contract.

## [2.7.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Price optimization** (`src/pricing.py`): demand-elasticity estimation
  (log-log fit), profit-maximizing price for constant-elasticity (`p* = c·ε/(ε+1)`)
  and linear demand, markdown/clearance pricing, and `recommend_price` with
  confidence + action. Extends the engine's newsvendor / volume-discount economics.
- **Pricing playbook** (`jobs/pricing.py`): client price/quantity history →
  elasticity → optimal price per SKU with profit-uplift; QA (`qa.verify_pricing`)
  + deliverables (Excel + report) reusing the job-fulfillment pipeline.
- `scripts/generate_pricing_sample.py` + `data/sample_pricing.csv`;
  `examples/run_pricing_job.py`; `jobs/SAMPLE_PRICING_REPORT.md`.
- 12 tests (132 total): pricing engine + pricing playbook.

### Changed
- `src/__init__.py` exports the pricing API; `jobs/README.md` lists the pricing
  job type.

### Added
- **Job-fulfillment layer** (`jobs/`) — package the engine for real supply-chain
  freelance work:
  - `jobs/intake.py`: detect/normalize any client schema (CSV/Excel, ERP or
    Kaggle-style) to the canonical demand schema, aggregated per period
  - `jobs/inventory_optimization.py`: playbook — forecast → (s,Q)/(R,S) policy →
    budget allocation → structured `JobReport`
  - `jobs/qa.py`: automated verification of the report's numbers (nothing ships
    until it passes)
  - `jobs/deliverables.py`: client-ready Excel workbook + Markdown report + CSV
  - `examples/run_inventory_job.py`: end-to-end CLI; `jobs/SAMPLE_REPORT.md`
- 8 job-layer tests (120 total)

### Notes
- Human-in-the-loop by design — automates the analysis/deliverable, not Upwork
  bidding or client comms (ToS).

### Added
- **Inventory Planner web UI** (`webapp/`): a 4-tab dashboard (Portfolio, SKU
  Detail with demand/forecast chart, Budget Planner, Forecast Quality) served by
  FastAPI over the engine — every number comes from `src/`. Vanilla JS, no Node /
  build step; one `uvicorn` command
- `GET /api/portfolio` runs forecasting → policy → constraints with live
  what-if params (service level, lead time, order cost, budget); validated inputs
- `scripts/generate_portfolio.py` seeds an 8-SKU demand portfolio
- `tests/test_webapp.py` (9 tests, 110 total) via FastAPI TestClient
- Screenshots in `webapp/screenshots/`

### Changed
- `requirements-dev.txt`: add fastapi / uvicorn / httpx for the web UI + its tests

### Added
- **`SqlDemandSource`** (`src/sources.py`): live demand from any DB-API 2.0
  connection (SQLite, Postgres, MySQL ...) via a table name or parameterised
  query; validates bare table names as SQL identifiers to avoid injection
- `examples/run_sql_source.py`: live-data demo (SQLite stand-in for an ERP feed)
  running the same source → forecast → policy chain
- 4 SQL-adapter tests (101 total, ~91% coverage)

### Changed
- README: live SQL data path documented; ERP/WMS adapter now a thin layer

## [2.3.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Pluggable data sources** (`src/sources.py`): `DemandSource` protocol with
  `CsvDemandSource` and `DataFrameDemandSource` adapters — the engine is no
  longer hard-wired to CSV; a SQL/API/ERP adapter just satisfies the protocol
- **Business constraints** (`src/constraints.py`): MOQ, case-pack rounding,
  shelf-life caps, and `allocate_under_budget` — a portfolio budget allocator
  that trims safety stock to fit while preserving cycle-stock economics
- `examples/run_constrained_plan.py`: full chain source → forecast → policy →
  constraints
- 14 tests (97 total, ~91% coverage)

### Changed
- README: "engine → product" section now reflects the assembled AUTO chain

## [2.2.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- **Demand forecasting front-end** (`src/forecasting.py`): moving average, simple
  exponential smoothing, and Croston (intermittent demand), with auto method
  selection by ADI classification
- Forecast-error σ_e — the theoretically correct dispersion for safety stock
  (Vandeput 2021, §4.2.5) — exposed via `ForecastResult.to_engine_inputs`
- `examples/run_forecast_to_policy.py`: end-to-end history → forecast → (s,Q) policy
- 13 forecasting tests (83 total, ~90% coverage)

### Changed
- README: forecasting documented; "Future extensions" reframed as the
  engine → product ("AUTO") roadmap

## [2.1.0] - 2026-06-19

### Added
- `pyproject.toml`: PEP 621 packaging + Ruff, pytest and coverage config (pip-installable, no more `PYTHONPATH` hack)
- `requirements-dev.txt` for test/lint tooling (`pytest`, `pytest-cov`, `ruff`)
- Direct unit tests for previously-untested modules: `policies`, `risk_period`, `demand_variability`, `discrete_demand`, `export` (23 new tests, 70 total)
- CI now lints with Ruff and enforces a 80% coverage gate (measured coverage ~90%)

### Fixed
- `tests/test_multi_echelon.py`: `test_gsm_case1_higher_cost_than_optimal` asserted nothing — added the intended cost comparison
- Removed dead code / unused locals and imports flagged by Ruff (`eoq`, `fill_rate`, `policies`, `distributions`, `powerbi_export`, several tests/examples)

### Changed
- `pytest` moved out of runtime `requirements.txt` into dev deps
- Test config moved from `pytest.ini` into `pyproject.toml`
