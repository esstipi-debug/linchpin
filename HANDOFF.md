# Linchpin — Session Handoff

**Date:** 2026-06-23 · **Repo:** `esstipi-debug/linchpin` · **Branch:** `main` (HEAD `d296775`)
**Purpose:** pick up Linchpin work in a fresh session without re-deriving context.

> A new Claude Code session in this repo also auto-loads memory: `MEMORY.md` →
> [[linchpin-project]], [[linchpin-verified-audit]], [[scm-test-datasets]],
> [[autonomous-loop-no-asking]]. This file is the human-readable consolidation.

## 1. What Linchpin is

Agentic supply-chain AI: a deterministic Python engine (forecasting, EOQ, safety
stock, (s,Q)/(R,S), multi-echelon, DDMRP, ABC-XYZ, financial KPIs, supplier
scorecards, MCDM sourcing, landed cost, cost-to-serve, reconciliation, voice
doc-reader) + an orchestrator agent, grounded in an **L3 knowledge graph** (23
SCM books) and packaged through a **client-ready deliverable generator**. It
**calculates the decision, recommends ranked actions, and emits a cited,
auditable report (md + xlsx)** — and where it can't act itself, hands off a
ready-to-execute packet (the "never unprotected" Guided Execution Layer).
Positioned to win Upwork inventory + SCM gigs (human sells, Linchpin produces 10x).

---

## 2. Current state (verified)

- **Tests:** 566 passing, ~95% coverage (`.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest`).
- **L3 graph** (`knowledge/scm-books/graph.json`): **1824 nodes / 3640 edges / 122 communities, 23 sources** (forecasting, pricing/revenue, SCM, inventory, manufacturing planning, operations mgmt, logistics, sustainability, leadership). Queried via `scm_agent/knowledge.py` (`search`/`explain`), cited by chapter.
- **Operating modes** (`scm_agent/modes.py`): `INVENTORY` (stock subset) vs `SCM` (superset, all tools) — each with persona + deliverable/KPI catalogue. `get_mode()`, `build_registry(mode)`, `orchestrator_for(mode)`.
- **Deliverable generator** (`src/deliverable.py` + `jobs/inventory_deliverable.py`): engine output → Markdown + XLSX with exec summary, quantified findings, KPI table w/ rationale, data-source map, L3 citations, coverage/handoff block.
- **S&OP/IBP cadence** (`src/sop.py` + `jobs/sop_deliverable.py`, gap #2, shipped PR #21): monthly demand→supply→reconciliation→exec workflow. Chase/level/hybrid aggregate-planning strategies → inventory-balance projection → cost/service/working-capital evaluation → `run_sop_cycle` emits a protected ranked OPTIONS outcome → the "S&OP/IBP deck" SCM mode advertises. Demo: `examples/run_sop_cycle.py`. Library + deliverable only — **not yet an agent tool**.
- **Cost-to-serve + working capital** (`src/cost_to_serve.py` + `src/working_capital.py` + `jobs/cost_to_serve_deliverable.py`, gap #3, shipped PR #22): activity-based CTS (product/fulfillment/returns/overhead → net-to-serve margin + whale curve) and the cash-to-cash / cash-release lens. Works **without** a precomputed profit column. Composes `landed_cost` + `financial_kpis.cash_to_cash`. Demo: `examples/run_cost_to_serve.py`. Library + deliverable only — **not yet an agent tool**.
- **Agent surface caveat:** the orchestrator wires only **3 tools** (`inventory_optimization`, `pricing`, `leadership_chain`); the other ~17 SCM modules are tested library cores + CLI/skills, not yet agent tools. (See [[linchpin-verified-audit]].) The agent now **narrates in each mode's persona** and **emits the premium "artifacts that sell" deck** (KPI rationale + L3 citations + coverage/handoff) via the optional `Tool.deck` hook — wired for `inventory_optimization` (PR #23). Pattern is ready to copy to new tools.

| `0f255d4` | deliverable generator (gap #1) |
| `468cc99` | deepened Chopra 32→312, added Heizer operations layer (→23 sources, 1824 nodes) |
| `bf2c316` | coverage tests (safety_stock 79→100%, simulation_opt 78→97%) |
| `57d0d63` | SCM test harness — Superstore |

**Follow-up session (PR-based, CI-gated):**

| Commit / PR | What |
|---|---|
| `32ead63` (PR #21) | **Gap #2 — S&OP/IBP cadence engine + deck.** `src/sop.py`, `jobs/sop_deliverable.py`, `examples/run_sop_cycle.py`, 28 tests. Also cleared pre-existing ruff debt (`src/deliverable.py` unused `field`, `examples/run_scm_olist.py` dead vars) that CI surfaced. Tests green on py3.11/3.12/3.13. |
| `ee156ea` (PR #22) | **Gap #3 — cost-to-serve + working-capital module.** `src/cost_to_serve.py`, `src/working_capital.py`, `jobs/cost_to_serve_deliverable.py`, `examples/run_cost_to_serve.py`, 24 tests. Purely additive. Green on py3.11/3.12/3.13. |
| `c6a702e` (PR #23) | **Item 4 — orchestrator wire-ups (unblocked half).** Mode persona threaded into `_narrative`; optional `Tool.deck` hook emits the premium deck alongside operational files (wired for `inventory_optimization`). `scm_agent/{orchestrator,modes,registry,tools}.py` + 8 tests. Backward-compatible. |

## 4. How to run (conventions)

- **Python 3.11**, `.venv` is uv-managed (no pip): `uv pip install --python .venv/Scripts/python.exe <pkg>`.
- **Tests:** `.venv/Scripts/python.exe -m pytest -q`. ASCII-only in console prints (Windows cp1252 — em dashes break it; markdown files written utf-8 are fine).
- **graphify:** `graphify update .` refreshes the **code** graph (AST-only, gitignored `graphify-out/`). The **books** graph lives in `knowledge/scm-books/` (committed). uv-tool graphify can break on Windows reparse points — reinstall with `uv tool install "graphifyy[kimi]"`; `pypdf` is required for PDF text extraction.
- **SCM test harnesses** (real data; `data/` is gitignored):
  - `examples/run_new_capabilities.py --data <canonical.csv>` — ABC-XYZ, DDMRP, KPIs, alerting, orchestrator
  - `examples/run_scm_superstore.py` · `run_scm_olist.py` · `run_scm_procurement.py` · `run_scm_dataco.py`
- **Kaggle:** token at `~/.kaggle/access_token` (KGAT); `kaggle`+`kagglehub` installed. Headless: `scripts/fetch_dataco.py`, `scripts/fetch_olist.py`, or `.venv/Scripts/kaggle.exe datasets download -d <slug> -p <dir> --unzip`.

**Local datasets** (gitignored, `data/kaggle/`): m5, online_retail, superstore, olist, **dataco (180k)**, procurement.

## 5. Next steps (research-backed roadmap, prioritized)

1. ~~**Gap #2 — S&OP/IBP cadence orchestration**~~ ✅ **DONE** (PR #21, `32ead63`). `src/sop.py` + `jobs/sop_deliverable.py` + `examples/run_sop_cycle.py`.
2. ~~**Gap #3 — Cost-to-serve + working-capital/cash-release module**~~ ✅ **DONE** (PR #22, `ee156ea`). `src/cost_to_serve.py` + `src/working_capital.py` + `jobs/cost_to_serve_deliverable.py` + `examples/run_cost_to_serve.py`.
3. **Wire-ups: register `run_sop_cycle` + cost-to-serve as orchestrator tools** (deferred from PR #21/#22 to avoid coupling `prepare()` to the parallel loop's actively-changing `jobs/intake.py`). Do this once `intake.py` settles — gives the agent its first end-to-end SCM (non-inventory) deliverables and starts closing the 3-tools gap. Tool contract: `scm_agent/tools.py` (prepare/run/qa/deliver); qa via `guided.verify_guided(...)`; deliver via the new `jobs/*_deliverable.build(...).write_all(...)`.
4. ~~**Other wire-ups** (persona into `_narrative`; deliverable generator in the `deliver` path)~~ ✅ **DONE** (PR #23, `c6a702e`). `Tool.deck` hook + per-mode persona.
5. **Gap #5 — Live connectors** (Shopify → Amazon SP-API → ERP): the execution unlock; **blocked** — needs the client's API keys per engagement.
6. **Finish Ivanov L3 coverage** (~70 nodes, partial): **blocked** — Kimi daily-token limit. Re-run when budget resets or via host-subagent extraction.

> **Status for the next session:** the two CFO/exec deliverables (S&OP deck, cost-to-serve deck) exist as libraries; the agent now narrates in persona and emits the premium inventory deck. **Every remaining roadmap item is currently blocked**: the tool-registration wire-up (item 3) on the parallel loop's `intake.py`; connectors (5) on client API keys; Ivanov L3 (6) on Kimi tokens. When `intake.py` settles, item 3 is the highest-leverage unblock — copy the `inventory_optimization` Tool pattern (now incl. the `deck` hook) to register `run_sop_cycle` and cost-to-serve, with `prepare()` doing its own periodization to stay decoupled.

## 6. Gotchas / warnings (read before committing)

- **Parallel autonomous loop is active on this same repo/main.** It owns and leaves uncommitted: `jobs/intake.py`, `src/batch.py`, `tests/test_batch.py`, `tests/test_jobs.py`. **Do NOT commit those** — stage only your own files. It also maintains `linchpin-project` memory + a deploy convention (branch → stash-not-mine → PR-merge-squash).
- **ROTATE two secrets** that landed in this session's transcript: the **Kaggle KGAT token** (`~/.kaggle/access_token`) and the **Kimi `MOONSHOT_API_KEY`** (`.env`). Both are gitignored/local but were pasted in chat.
- **Kimi backend limits are tight** (org concurrency 3, RPM 20, **TPD 1.5M**) — bulk L3 ingestion repeatedly 429'd. Reliable pattern: host-subagent extraction (no API key) for big books; Kimi only for small/medium with `max_concurrency` 1-2, `max_retry_depth=0`.
- **DataCo CSV contains customer PII** (email/name/password/street) — analysis is aggregate-only; never read or surface PII.
- `.env` and `data/` and `graphify-out/` and `deliverables/` are gitignored.
