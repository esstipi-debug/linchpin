"""Control Tower monitors as a registrable cron job -- the "sense" loop
finally wired to a schedule.

``scm_agent/monitors.py`` shipped the five (+1) monitors and
``run_all_monitors()`` deliberately as a plain, one-shot, all-default-kwargs
function, with ``config/monitors.yaml``'s ``cadence_minutes`` explicitly "data
only in this PR (no scheduler job reads it yet)" -- its own docstring names
``jobs.scheduler.ScheduledJob`` as the expected future home. This module is
that home: it wraps ``run_all_monitors()`` in the exact ``ScheduledJob.func``
shape ``jobs/price_monitor.py`` and ``jobs/price_watch.py`` already use, ready
for a DEDICATED monitors cron on the monitors' own cadence.

**Not wired into the price endpoint.** ``POST /api/jobs/run-scheduled``
(``webapp/app.py``) already runs ``run_all_monitors`` INLINE on every tick
(threading in the price-signal events the two price jobs emit), so the
inventory monitors already sense in production on the price-cron cadence.
``MONITORS_JOB`` is therefore deliberately absent from
``jobs.scheduled_jobs.production_registry()`` -- it is the sense cycle
packaged for a SEPARATE driver (a dedicated GitHub Actions cron on the
monitors' own hourly cadence, or a real ``BackgroundScheduler`` should the
``tower`` extra ever be installed), never a second copy double-running inside
the price endpoint. See ``jobs/scheduled_jobs.py``'s own note.

This module also hosts :func:`run_concierge_alerts` -- the Kern Alerts **Fase
1 concierge** primitive (MONETIZATION_BRIEF §7): run the monitors over a
merchant's uploaded stock snapshot and hand the operator a ready-to-send
:class:`~scm_agent.merchant_alerts.MerchantAlert`. It is manual and
operator-triggered, NOT a scheduled job -- the concierge phase is exactly the
"no app until there are payers" gate the brief draws.

Golden rule 9 ("todo componente continuo degrada a batch") holds: no
background thread, no sleeping, no in-process scheduler. ``run_once()`` (tests,
CI) and an external cron are the only callers.

**Deliberately notification-silent by default.** ``run_all_monitors`` emits its
events onto the shared :class:`~scm_agent.events.EventLedger` (dedup'd), which
is what the Tower / console feed reads -- that alone is the useful product of
scheduling it. Pushing an OPERATOR Slack ping every tick is opt-in
(``notify_operator=True`` / ``LINCHPIN_MONITORS_NOTIFY=1``): registering this
job in production must not start spamming a webhook the moment it lands, and a
MERCHANT-facing send is a different surface entirely
(``scm_agent/merchant_alerts.py``, reviewed-then-sent by a concierge operator,
never auto-pushed from here). This job is T1 sense-only: it reads state and
records events. It never stages a PO, never touches an ERP, never imports
``src/writeback.py``.
