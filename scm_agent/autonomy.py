"""Autonomy tiers -- A3 "execute" layer (Linchpin 3.0 PR-6, plan S5).

``config/event_routing.yaml`` already carries an ``autonomy_tier`` per route
(PR-4), and its own header comment says the quiet part out loud: "tiers are
enforced starting PR-6's autonomy.py; here the tier is carried as data only".
This module is that enforcement -- it turns the label into actual behavior
for the two shapes a routed tool result can take (plan S5, A3 row):

(a) **Analysis-only tools** (the common case -- most of ``scm_agent/tools.py``'s
    37 registered tools): a routed run produces a
    ``scm_agent.types.JobResult`` with no system-of-record write attached.
    :func:`enforce_analysis_tier` gates it:

      - **T1** auto-execute: the tool already ran (through the real QA gate)
        and ``handle_event_tiered`` already let ``notify()`` fire -- this is
        informational autonomy, not a human gate. The tool's own protected
        outcome (``result.guided``) is returned as-is. What makes this
        "audited, not silent" is a durable :class:`AutonomyRecord` written to
        :class:`AutonomyLedger` with ``status=STATUS_AUTO_EXECUTED``.
      - **T2** one-click approval: the analysis still ran (and is still
        QA-gated), but the result is held as a ``STATUS_PENDING``
        :class:`AutonomyRecord` instead of being announced as done --
        ``handle_event_tiered`` suppresses the automatic notify for this
        tier. The returned outcome is a ``HANDOFF`` naming the pending
        record's id; :func:`acknowledge_pending` is the accept/approve
        function PR-7's ``POST /api/approvals/{id}`` calls to complete it.
      - **T3** full escalation: wrapped in a real ``ESCALATED`` outcome via
        ``src/escalation.py`` (never a hand-rolled one) and recorded with
        ``status=STATUS_ESCALATED`` -- never treated as done, never
        auto-notified.

(b) **Writeback-capable tool results** (``odoo_replenishment``,
    ``excel_replenishment`` -- the few tools whose report carries a staged
    ``src.writeback.Changeset``, not just a ``JobResult``):
    :func:`enforce_writeback_tier` gates the changeset directly:

      - **T1** auto-applies (``writeback.apply(..., auto_apply_reversible=True)``)
        ONLY when ``changeset.risk_tier == writeback.TIER_REVERSIBLE``. An
        irreversible changeset is downgraded to the same human-approval
        ``HANDOFF`` as T2 -- see that function's docstring for why this does
        not weaken ``writeback.requires_approval()``'s hard-coded invariant,
        only adds a second, independent layer in front of it.
      - **T2** stages only: returns a ``HANDOFF`` naming the exact
        ``approve()``/``apply()`` call a human must make. Never calls either.
      - **T3** escalates outright, before any apply is attempted.

Neither path needs its own ``jobs/qa.py``-style ``verify_*``/``*_passed``
gate: there is no new deliverable/report here to QA -- the routed tool's own
QA veto (plan rule 2) already ran upstream, and every ``GuidedOutcome`` this
module returns is itself checked by ``src.guided.verify_guided`` at
construction time (``as_handoff``/``as_executed``/``escalate`` all raise or
enforce the contract already). This mirrors PR-1/PR-2's precedent of
skipping a QA function where the module has no ``JobReport`` to gate.

    For the few tools whose report carries a real system-of-record write
    (``jobs/excel_replenishment_job.py``'s ``ExcelReplenishmentReport.changeset``,
    ``jobs/odoo_job.py``'s equivalent) instead of only a ``JobResult`` --
    ``enforce_analysis_tier`` above never sees this, because ``JobResult``
    itself carries no ``Changeset`` field.

    T3 escalates outright, before any apply is attempted. Staging itself
    (``writeback.stage()``) is a pure, side-effect-free dry-run computation
    with no write to the real system of record, so "escalate before even
    staging" (plan S5) and "escalate instead of applying an already-staged
    changeset" are behaviorally identical here: either way nothing is ever
    written until a human signs off.

    T2 stages only -- returns a HANDOFF naming the exact ``approve()`` +
    ``apply()`` call a human (or PR-7's endpoint) must make. This function
    never calls either for T2.

    T1 auto-applies (``writeback.apply(..., auto_apply_reversible=True)``)
    ONLY when ``changeset.risk_tier == writeback.TIER_REVERSIBLE``. Any other
    tier (irreversible, or the degenerate read tier) is downgraded to the
    SAME human-approval HANDOFF as T2. This is the safety invariant PR-6
    exists to enforce, and it is deliberately checked HERE, before ``apply()``
    is ever called, rather than relying solely on ``writeback.apply()`` to
    refuse: ``writeback.requires_approval()`` already hard-codes "irreversible
    always needs a human" independently of ``auto_apply_reversible`` (see
    ``src/writeback.py``), so this check does not weaken or bypass that rule
    -- it is a second, independent layer in front of the same invariant. Even
    if this check were ever accidentally removed, ``apply()`` would still
    raise ``WritebackRefused`` instead of silently writing an irreversible
    change with ``approval=None``.
