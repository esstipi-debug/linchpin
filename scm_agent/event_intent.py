"""Event -> tool routing (Linchpin 3.0 PR-4, F0 -- ``scm_agent/event_intent.py``).

This is Track A's A2 "decide" layer wired ahead of its own PR (A2 is listed
against ``config/event_routing.yaml`` in plan S5, but the plan places the
config file itself in F0 alongside this module -- "reusa el registry
intacto", plan S4.2). A monitor (PR-5's ``monitors.py``, not built yet) will
call :func:`handle_event` with an :class:`~scm_agent.events.Event` it just
emitted; today, a test calling it with a synthetic event exercises exactly
the same path -- there is no monitor-shaped special case here.

Pipeline, matching the F0 acceptance criterion (plan S4, "Criterio de
aceptacion F0"):

    Event -> resolve_route() [config/event_routing.yaml]
          -> build_params()  [PARAM_BUILDERS[route.param_builder]]
          -> Orchestrator.run(..., job_type=route.tool)  [real prepare->run->qa->deliver]
          -> notify() on STATUS_OK only

The routing table is DATA (plan rule: "ruteo como dato") -- adding a new
event type means adding a YAML entry + (if the tool needs payload shaped
differently than an existing builder) one small function in
``PARAM_BUILDERS``, never editing ``scm_agent/registry.py`` or
``scm_agent/tools.py``.
