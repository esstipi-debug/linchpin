"""L3 knowledge layer — queries the SCM knowledge graphs for the agent.

Two graphs, one query surface:
  - books graph (knowledge/scm-books/graph.json) — domain theory from SCM
    books (incl. supply-chain leadership / the CHAIN model), with chapter
    citations. Committed to the repo.
  - code graph (graphify-out/graph.json) — the codebase structure. Gitignored
    (regenerable), so it may be absent on a fresh clone — handled gracefully.

The agent uses this to ground decisions: define a concept, find which method
applies, cite the book/chapter, and (the bridge) jump from theory to the
function that implements it.

Pure read-only. Frozen dataclasses for results. Stdlib only.
