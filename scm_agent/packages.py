"""Commercial package runner - several registered tools, one QA-gated deliverable.

A *package* is a commercial bundle (see ``documentation/paquetes/``): a fixed set
of registry tools run together for one client, producing every tool's own
deliverable PLUS one consolidated package deck. The runner reuses each Tool's
``prepare -> run -> qa -> deliver`` callbacks verbatim (the same ones the
orchestrator drives) - no job logic is duplicated; only ``intent.classify`` is
skipped because the operator explicitly chose the package.

The per-tool guarantee "QA fails => no deliverable" is preserved at PACKAGE
level by running in two phases:

1. **Compute** every step (prepare/run/qa) with nothing written to the output
   directory. Derived inputs (e.g. the cycle-count list built from the ABC-XYZ
   classification) go to a throwaway scratch dir.
2. **Write** deliverables only if every step that executed passed QA. One
   failing step - required or optional - means nothing is written at all: a
   package is a single coherent deliverable, not a folder of partial results.

Optional steps whose input file is absent (or whose gate says no, e.g. Odoo
without credentials) are *skipped*, recorded in the coverage table, and do not
block the package.

# limit=3 shallow-pool recall bug fixed in jobs/integrated_plan.py and
# jobs/price_intelligence.py (3.0-audit finding #7) affected _run_step too:
# with a top-3 candidate pool, on-topic citations ranked below #3 never reached
# the strict 2-hop gate, so 6 tools (inventory_optimization, pricing,
# excel/odoo_replenishment, risk, reconciliation) shipped ZERO citations in
# every package that runs them, incl. inventory_optimization in every inventory
# package. Widening the pool recovers all six with on-topic citations.
# The ceiling is EMPIRICAL and must be RE-MEASURED whenever a source is added to
# the books graph -- it MOVES, in both directions. At 25 sources data_quality
# re-admitted TQM/QFD hub-noise at pool 11 and cycle_count cash-cycle noise at 12,
# so the pool was pinned at 8. Adding Khan et al. (2022) as source #27 shifted the
# ranking enough that pool 8 now STARVES four tools that previously had citations
# (odoo_replenishment, risk, digital_twin, launch_readiness), while the noise
# threshold rose: measured across all 45 anchored tools on the 3002-node graph,
# 16 is the exact ceiling -- at 17 data_quality re-admits "Cost of Quality" and
# "House of Quality". 16 also recovers price_watch, a pre-existing zero.
# Verify with a full 45-tool sweep, NOT just the package tools: the tools that
# silently regressed here were precisely the ones no test covered. See
# tests/test_packages_citations.py::test_no_anchored_tool_regressed_to_zero.
