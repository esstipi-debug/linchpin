#
# One command to take a fresh container (or a bare venv) to a state where the
# FULL suite runs green and every capability can be exercised:
#
#     bash scripts/setup-test-env.sh
#
# Why this exists (the failure it fixes): `pip install -r requirements-dev.txt`
# is all-or-nothing. In this container two things abort the WHOLE transaction --
# so a plain install leaves you with *zero* packages, not "most of them":
#
#   1. `extruct` -> `jstyleson` fails to build a wheel against the container's
#      old setuptools ("AttributeError: install_layout"). Upgrading pip /
#      setuptools / wheel first makes it build.
#   2. Debian-managed packages (cryptography, PyJWT, wheel, setuptools) can't be
#      cleanly uninstalled by pip ("RECORD file not found"), so any dependency
#      that wants to upgrade them aborts the run. `--ignore-installed` on those
#      specific packages sidesteps it without touching the rest.
#
# Idempotent and non-interactive: safe to run repeatedly.
