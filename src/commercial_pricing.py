"""Kern's own GMV-band commercial pricing (Stage 2 of the GMV-band GTM plan,
capability A2 in docs/superpowers/plans/2026-07-18-kern-gmv-band-gtm.md).

This module computes what Kern CHARGES a customer for a package (Starter/
Growth/Scale/Retainer). Do not confuse it with ``src/pricing.py``,
``jobs/repricing.py``, or ``src/pricing_intel/`` - those price the CLIENT's
OWN product catalog and are unrelated.

**Primary-axis resolution (the one design nuance a prior adversarial review
flagged as ambiguous - resolved in the plan's Part 2, mirrored here):**
package and revenue band are 1:1 (Starter=$1-3M/yr, Growth=$3-8M/yr,
Scale=$8M+/yr). ``base_price`` and the SKU fairness rule are looked up by
``package_key`` - **package_key is the source of truth for price, never
``annual_revenue``.** ``annual_revenue`` is used only to (a) suggest a
better-fitting package and (b) flag a mismatch when the requested package
doesn't match the buyer's declared revenue - it never silently overrides the
requested package's price. Below the lowest band (sub-$1,000,000/yr),
``needs_clarification`` is set instead of a silent clamp (route to the
LatAm reduced-scope Starter tier, or ask the buyer to confirm).

SKU count is a SECONDARY fairness adjuster, reusing the already-shipped
floor/block/ceiling arithmetic verbatim (see ``scm_agent/package_specs.py``'s
STARTER/GROWTH ``price`` strings - this module's constants are cross-checked
against that prose). Scale and Retainer are flat: ``fairness_adjustment`` is
always 0 for those two.

No I/O, pure functions/dataclasses only - mirrors ``src/contingent_fee.py``'s
shape (frozen-dataclass result, validated bounds, a floor/ceiling, a
``render_*`` prose function).
