"""Per-client API key store for the read-only MCP server (Phase A go-to-market).

Linchpin's MCP server sells access to individual paying clients, each needing
their own revocable credential - unlike ``webapp/security.py``'s single shared
``LINCHPIN_API_KEY`` (fine for gating one operator's own dashboard, wrong for
multiple distinct customers). Phase A billing is manual (Stripe Payment Link,
then the operator issues a key by hand - see ``examples/issue_mcp_key.py``), so
this store only needs issue/validate/revoke, not usage-based metering.

Keys are high-entropy random tokens (``secrets.token_urlsafe``); only their
SHA-256 hash is ever persisted, mirroring how GitHub/Stripe-style tokens work -
the plaintext is returned once, at ``issue()`` time, and cannot be recovered
from the store afterward. SQLite (stdlib), same pattern as
``src.writeback_store.SqliteAuditLedger``.
