"""linchpin-voice-followup orchestration (capability M16) - the credential-free loop.

Wires the voice brain end to end with no phone network and no credentials:

    compliance gate -> build_agent_config -> place call -> capture CallOutcome -> sync

Every branch returns a ``VoiceFollowupResult`` carrying a never-unprotected
``GuidedOutcome`` (Guided Execution Layer, src/guided.py): the call is either executed
and its result safely staged/applied to the system of record, or the human is handed a
ranked escalation / prepared manual follow-up. The dial itself is injected as a
``VoiceCaller``; with ``DryRunCaller`` the whole flow is testable offline.
