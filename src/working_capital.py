"""Working-capital / cash-release engine (capability gap #3, the CFO lens).

Turns the cash-to-cash cycle into dollars: how much working capital each cycle day
ties up, and how much cash is freed by improving each lever. Inventory and payables
scale on COGS (they are carried at cost); receivables scale on revenue (billed at
sales value). Reducing DIO or DSO, or extending DPO, releases cash one-for-one with
the drop in net working capital.

Composes ``financial_kpis.cash_to_cash`` for the cycle length so the two modules can
never disagree. Pure / deterministic. Reference: SCOR cash-to-cash (AM.1.1); Chopra &
Meindl, working-capital levers; retail-math DIO/DSO/DPO.
