"""Safe-staging writeback control plane (capability M15).

The agent never mutates a client's system of record directly. It:
  1. STAGES a dry-run ``Changeset`` (field-level before/after) without writing;
  2. classifies it by RISK TIER (read / reversible / irreversible);
  3. requires a valid, matching, unexpired ``Approval`` for anything that is not
     auto-applicable under policy;
  4. APPLIES idempotently (the same idempotency_key never lands twice);
  5. records an AUDIT entry so any applied changeset can be ROLLED BACK.

This module is pure and ships an ``InMemoryStore`` reference implementation that
stands in for a real connector (ERP / Excel / DB). Real connectors implement the
same read/applied_keys/claim/release/commit/rollback surface; the safety logic
here is connector-agnostic.
