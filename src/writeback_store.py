"""Persistent audit/idempotency ledger for the writeback plane (SQLite, stdlib).

Real connectors (Odoo, etc.) already persist *records* in their own system of
record. What they do NOT persist on their own is the writeback plane's own
audit/idempotency bookkeeping - today a plain process-memory dict
(``applied_keys()`` / ``commit()`` / ``rollback()``) that is lost on restart,
letting the same ``idempotency_key`` re-apply after a crash or redeploy, and
destroying the data needed to roll a change back.

``SqliteAuditLedger`` is a drop-in replacement for that in-memory dict, shared
by ``InMemoryStore`` and any real connector's system-of-record wrapper (see
``src.connectors.odoo._ReorderRuleStore`` / ``_DraftPoStore``). It is optional
and additive: nothing that already worked without a ledger changes behavior.

        ``claims``/``applied`` as the concurrency primitive: two connections racing to
        insert the same key can only have one INSERT succeed - SQLite serializes
        writers at the file level, so this is safe across separate worker PROCESSES
        sharing this file (the scenario a multi-worker webapp deployment actually
        has - one connection per process/request). It is NOT safe to share a single
        ``SqliteAuditLedger``/connection across multiple THREADS: Python's ``sqlite3``
        defaults to ``check_same_thread=True``, so a non-owning thread already raises
        ``ProgrammingError`` on any call, independent of this method. (Cross-thread
        safety for a single in-process store is provided separately, by
        ``AuditBookkeeping``'s own lock, for the non-ledger path.)

        The first statement atomically checks both "already fully applied" and
        "already claimed by another in-flight apply()", so there is no separate
        check-then-insert gap of its own. If a claim already exists, it is only
        stolen when it is older than ``CLAIM_STALE_SECONDS`` - i.e. almost certainly
        orphaned by a process that claimed and then crashed before ``record()`` or
        ``release()`` ever ran - via a second, equally atomic conditional UPDATE
        (only one racing stealer's ``WHERE claimed_at < ?`` can still match after the
        first stealer's UPDATE refreshes ``claimed_at``).

        ``now`` defaults to the real wall clock; pass an explicit value only for
        deterministic tests. Returns True if the caller now owns the key (must
        follow up with ``record()`` or ``release()``); False if it is already
