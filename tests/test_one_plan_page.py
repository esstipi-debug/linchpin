"""HTTP-level tests for GET /one-plan (the English AU/NZ agency landing page,
webapp/one_plan_page.py).

This page mirrors webapp/stocky_alternative_page.py exactly (own English shell,
same dark/teal visual system, same two real offers, same FAQ + JSON-LD
mechanism) but positions Kern as a fractional planning team rather than a Stocky
replacement. It carries real brand/compliance stakes:

  * a hard banned-words list must never appear in the rendered HTML, and
  * the fractional-team economics must be framed against a loaded full-time
    planner hire (~USD 100-120k/yr), giving the SHIPPED Starter price
    (USD 900/mo = ~USD 10,800/yr) a ratio of ~10% -- NOT the stale "~40-50%"
    figure a prior draft computed on a since-repriced Growth tier.

Both are asserted below against the *rendered* HTML, not template literals.
