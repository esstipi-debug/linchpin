"""Kern's read-only MCP server (Phase A go-to-market — see linchpin-monetization-plan).

Exposes 33 of the 37 registered agent tools to remote MCP clients (other AI
agents, via Streamable HTTP): analysis only, no writeback. `odoo_replenishment`
and `excel_replenishment` mutate a client's system of record and are
deliberately NOT exposed here — that stays for direct clients only, gated by the
audited writeback safety plane (`src/writeback.py`), not by anything in this
file. `leadership_chain` and `warehouse_layout` are also off this surface: they
don't consume tabular rows, so the bridge below has nothing to feed them.

The tool surface itself lives in `webapp/mcp_tool_specs.py` (one spec per tool:
name, job_type, title, calling contract) — this module just registers each spec
against the shared bridge.

Bridge design: an MCP tool call carries data inline (JSON rows), but every
underlying job's `prepare()` reads a CSV path (`Orchestrator.run(data_path=...)`).
`_run_analysis_tool` is the one shared seam that writes `rows` to a throwaway
temp CSV, calls the SAME orchestrator entry point `webapp/app.py`'s
`POST /api/jobs` uses, and reads back the markdown report `deliver()` already
writes — reusing the existing client-ready deliverable formatting instead of
inventing a second serialization path. `job_type` is passed explicitly, so the
orchestrator's brief-based intent classifier is bypassed entirely (confidence=1.0,
see `scm_agent/intent.py::classify`'s `job_type_override` path) — each tool call
deterministically hits the tool it names, no NLU guessing.
